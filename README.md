Playing Out with IOT 
PSMoveGames

We have built several games for young people to play building upon the open source Thomas Perl's PlayStation Move controller SDK (https://thp.io/).

The PlayStation Move controllers are really suited for the Playing Out with IOT project.

They are robust and provide designers with rotation, accelerometer and magnetometer.

psmovepairMacOSX is reproduced from https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi.

PSMoveOSX uses this library to create three test prototypes

This includes digital skipping, a hot-potato game and a test suite for playing around with the controller lights.
